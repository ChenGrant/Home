		<h1>How Does Math Occur In Our Lives</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="big">
			We use Math in our everyday lives for the little and big things. We could use it for something as simple as determining which bag of chips is more worth it. Also, we also use Math to find out the cost it takes you to buy 900 watermelonsâ€¦ don&#39;t worry, that only happens in Math problems. People use the basics of Math such as counting, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. We use it all the time when we are dealing with money. We use it to find the price, discounts, taxes, mortgages, etc. When you are planning to reach a certain destination in a vehicle of transportation, you will have to understand distance, speed and time. In addition, you&#39;ll need to use the coordinates wisely to stay safe and on track. Stocks are a great example of how you need to recognize graphs, statistics, and trends in order to make the most money. When you bake, the timing and the correct amount of ingredients added is critical which relates back to Math.

			Those are just the basics, but there are people who use Math at a very high degree. People at NASA have to work with several numbers with a variety of variables in order to find the most efficient path and route in space to launch their spaceships. Alan Turing was a man who decrypted the Enigma machine. He cracked German codes with patterning in World War 2 which practically saved Britain from the Nazi&#39;s. As you can see, we use Math every day. From cooking and driving, all the way to launching spaceships and preventing wars, Math remains a vital component in our lives. Honestly, if we didn&#39;t use it, we would probably still be living like cavemen. Other subjects that promote more advanced technology such as Science is dependant on Math. So without Math, there would be no improvement in technology.
