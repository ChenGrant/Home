		<h2>Discovered Or Invented?</h2>
		<p id="p01">
			So we all know that Math is very important, but how did it originate&#63; Who invented it&#63; Was it even invented or discovered&#63; No one knows for sure how Math has originated. However, according to the Huffington Post, Math was invented and not discovered because it consists of rules that we have purposely created instead of rules that naturally happen. It&#39;s the result of our human consciousness and we&#39;ve built Math to make our tasks more convenient.
